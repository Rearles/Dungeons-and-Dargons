# Dungeons-and-Dargons
This is me trying some things with Angular


To do:

I want to be able to view the Ability Scores in DnD

I want to be able to select a race and see a list of spell links for that race

I want to be able to select those spell links to have a list of spells attached to a login

I want to be able to roll a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100,
